      <Category>Drama</Category>
      <Description>Starring Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, the zany comedy of The Abbott and Costello Show graced the airwaves from 1942 until 1948, after a short stint as summer replacement for The Fred Allen Show in 1941. There were often tongue twisting or otherwise confusing dialogs Who' on First is the most famous and Costello was always getting into trouble. The vaudeville style repartee kept the live audience in stitches. In the tradition of the day, there was always a song, courtesy of Connie Haines or Marilyn Maxwell.</Description>

      <Description>2000 Plus was an American old time radio series that ran on the Mutual Broadcasting System from March 15, 1950 to January 2, 1952 in various 30-minute time slots. It was the first adult science fiction series on radio, airing one month prior to the better known Dimension X. Unlike X Mius One, 2000 Plus used all new material rather than adapting exixting published stories. Aside from offering an exciting plots, the stories focus on that generation's contemporary anxieties about the changing world, and the effects and dangers of technology to humankind.</Description>

      <Description>Taking its name from a popular series of mystery novels, Inner Sanctum Mysteries debuted over NBC's Blue Network in January 1941. Last broadcast October 5, 1952. Inner Sanctum Mysteries featured one of the most memorable and atmospheric openings in radio history: an organist hit a dissonant chord, a doorknob turned and the famous "creaking door" slowly began to open. Every week, Inner Sanctum Mysteries told stories of ghosts, murderers and lunatics. Produced in New York, the cast usually consisted of veteran radio actors, with occasional guest appearances by such Hollywood stars Boris Karloff, Frank Sinatra, Orson Welles and Peter Lorre.</Description>

      <Description>Have Gun Will Travel radio show broadcast 106 episodes on CBS between November 23, 1958, and November 22, 1960. During the fifties, many radio programs made the transition to the ever-growing medium called television. Some more successful than others. John Dehner was cast as Paladin. Dehner was the same man who many years before, originally didn't want to play Matt Dillon because he didn't want to be typecast in a western. The first thirty-some radio scripts were adaptations from the television series. After more than twenty episodes, they realized the show was not as successful for radio as it was for television. Some changes needed to be made, so the radio productions would differ from the television. After two years and 106 broadcasts, Have Gun Will Travel slowly faded away. John Dehner died on February 4, 1992, in Santa Barbara, California, from complications of emphysema and diabetes. He was 76.</Description>

It went on to be translated into 17 languages and broadcast worldwide. Each half-hour episode would usually end with a dramatic cliffhanger, to increase the audience's incentive to tune in to the next episode. The original magnetic recordings of the show were erased shortly after broadcast, and for several decades, it was believed that no recordings of the show still survived. However, in 1986, a set of mis-filed Transcription Service discs were discovered, containing complete copies of the three original series.</Description>
