      <Description>
        The Navy Lark was a BBC Radio comedy series that ran for 15 series between 1959 and 1976 with largely the sane cast, and, some would say, the same jokes. An ensemble cast played a number of characters, many with distinct catchphrases. Among the most memorable are the thieving Chief Petty Officer Pertwee, the oldest Sub Lieutenant in the Navy, Sub Lieutenant Phillips, Able Seaman Goldstein, Wren Chasen (the only sensible person in the crew), the long suffering Lieutenant Murray and their collective nemesis, Commander Povey.

      <Description>
        Nightfall is the title of a radio drama series aired on CBC Radio from July 1980 to June 1983. While primarily a supernatural/horror series, Nightfall featured some episodes in other genres, such as science fiction, mystery, fantasy, and human drama. One episode was even adapted from a folk song by Stan Rogers. Some of Nightfall's episodes were so terrifying that the CBC registered numerous complaints and some affiliate stations dropped it. Despite this, the series went on to become one of the most popular shows in CBC Radio history, running 100 episodes that featured a mix of original tales and adaptations of both classic and obscure short stories.

        In 'Hardcore History' journalist and broadcaster Dan Carlin takes his 'Martian', unorthodox way of thinking and
        applies it to the past. Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Adolf Hitler? What would Apaches with
        modern weapons be like? Will our modern civilization ever fall like civilizations from past eras? This isn't academic
        history (and Carlin isn't a historian) but the podcast's unique blend of high drama, masterful narration and Twilight
        Zone-style twists has entertained millions of listeners.

There were often tongue twisting or otherwise confusing dialogs Who' on First is the most famous and Costello was always getting into trouble. The vaudeville style repartee kept the live audience in stitches. In the tradition of the day, there was always a song, courtesy of Connie Haines or Marilyn Maxwell.</Description>

During the fifties, many radio programs made the transition to the ever-growing medium called television. Some more successful than others. John Dehner was cast as Paladin. Dehner was the same man who many years before, originally didn't want to play Matt Dillon because he didn't want to be typecast in a western. The first thirty-some radio scripts were adaptations from the television series. After more than twenty episodes, they realized the show was not as successful for radio as it was for television. Some changes needed to be made, so the radio productions would differ from the television. After two years and 106 broadcasts, Have Gun Will Travel slowly faded away. John Dehner died on February 4, 1992, in Santa Barbara, California, from complications of emphysema and diabetes. He was 76.</Description>

      <Description>Journey Into Space was a BBC Radio science fiction program. In the UK it was the last radio program to attract a bigger evening audience than television. It went on to be translated into 17 languages and broadcast worldwide. Each half-hour episode would usually end with a dramatic cliffhanger, to increase the audience's incentive to tune in to the next episode. The original magnetic recordings of the show were erased shortly after broadcast, and for several decades, it was believed that no recordings of the show still survived. However, in 1986, a set of mis-filed Transcription Service discs were discovered, containing complete copies of the three original series.</Description>
